		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>The easiest way to get started using <strong>birthdayfeed</strong> is to create a spreadsheet in Google Spreadsheets with the birthdays you want to be reminded of.</p>
		<p>The spreadsheet must be formatted in this way:</p>
		<table border=1>
			<tr>
				<th></th><th>A</th><th>B</th><th>C</th><th>D</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>1</strong></td><td>Harry Potter</td><td>1980</td><td>7</td><td>31</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>2</strong></td><td>Tom Riddle</td><td>1926</td><td>12</td><td>31</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Column A is a name, Column B is the year of the birthday, Column C is the month, and Column D is the day. <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AsaQpHJE_LShcDJ0dWNudHFZWVJqS1dvb3FLWkVrS0E">See an example spreadsheet</a>.</p>
		<p>If you know someone's birthday, but not the year they were born, use "0" for the year and you will be notified, but not told how old that person will turn on their upcoming birthday.</p>
		<p>Once you have the data in a Google Spreadsheet, you will need to publish it as a CSV file. You do this by following these steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the <strong>File</strong> menu, choose <strong>Publish to the Web...</strong></li>
			<li>Check the box for <strong>Automatically republish when changes are made</strong></li>
			<li>Click the <strong>Start publishing</strong> button</li>
			<li>In the <strong>Get a link to the published data</strong> section, change the first setting to <strong>CSV (comma-separated values)</strong> and the second setting to the sheet that has the birthdays on it</li>
			<li>Copy the link. You will get something like <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p2tucntqYYRjKWooqKZEkKA&amp;output=csv"><code>http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p2tucntqYYRjKWooqKZEkKA&amp;output=csv</code></a></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Come back to this page and paste the link to the CSV file into the <strong>data location:</strong> field at the top of the page. Subscribe to the page that is presented to you.</p>
		<p><strong>In a feed reader</strong>, a birthday will appear in the feed seven days before it is to be celebrated, which should be enough time to prepare a card or gift for the acquaintance.</p>
		<p><strong>In a calendar</strong>, there will only be an event for the acquaintance's next birthday from the current day.</p>
		<h2>Details</h2>
		<h3>Data Location</h3>
		<p>You don't have to use Google Spreadsheets to store your data. You can put a CSV file anywhere on the Internet. birthdayfeed does not cache the data location or the data itself.</p>
		<h3>Leap Day</h3>
		<p>Some people are born on February 29, but there is not a February 29 in every year. In years without such a day, the birthday will be assigned to March 1. To remove ambiguity, birthdayfeed mentions the original date of birth as well as the next birthday.</p>
